# ECom_Data-Analysis
**E-commerce Supply Chain Analysis**    In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of an e-commerce supply chain using Python and interactive visualization libraries like **Plotly**. The analysis aimed to uncover insights into product pricing, sales trends, revenue distribution, shipping costs, and product defects.
