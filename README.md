**E-commerce Supply Chain Analysis**  

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of an e-commerce supply chain using Python and interactive visualization libraries like **Plotly**. The analysis aimed to uncover insights into product pricing, sales trends, revenue distribution, shipping costs, and product defects. Here's an overview of the key objectives and findings:  

### **Objectives:**  
1. **Product Pricing & Revenue Visualization**: Identified trends in product pricing and revenue to determine top-performing items.  
2. **Sales Analysis by Product Type**: Analyzed sales distribution across various product categories.  
3. **Revenue by Shipping Carriers**: Calculate the total revenue generated by different shipping carriers.  
4. **Revenue Analysis by SKU**: Evaluated revenue contribution of individual SKUs.  
5. **Order Quantity per SKU**: Analyzed the order volume for each SKU.  
6. **Shipping Costs Analysis**: Assessed the shipping costs associated with different carriers.  
7. **Transportation Mode Cost Distribution**: Identified cost distribution across transportation modes (e.g., air, sea, road).  
8. **Product Defect Rate**: Analyzed the rate of defects occurring during shipping to highlight areas of improvement.  

### **Tools & Techniques:**  
- **Data Handling**: Utilized `pandas` for data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation.  
- **Visualizations**: Leveraged `plotly.express` and `plotly.graph_objects` to create dynamic, interactive charts and graphs, making insights easily understandable.  
- **Insights Discovery**: Uncovered revenue-driving products, cost-intensive shipping methods, and key areas for operational optimization.

### **Key Takeaways:**  
This analysis provided actionable insights into optimizing supply chain efficiency, reducing shipping costs, and improving product defect rates during transit. The project also demonstrated the potential for using advanced data visualization tools to make complex data more accessible and insightful for decision-makers.
